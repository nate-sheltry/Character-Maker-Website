	"traits": {
		"bruiserInfo" : "A little slower, but a little bigger. You may not hit as often, but they will feel it when you do! Your total action points are lowered, but your Strength is increased. You get a 2 point bonus to Strength, but lose 2 Action Points.",
		"fastShotInfo" : "You don't have time for a targeted attack, because you attack faster than normal people. It costs you one less action point to use a weapon. You cannot perform targeted shots, but all weapons take one less action point to use. Note that the Fast Shot trait has no effect on HtH or Melee attacks.",
		"finesseInfo" : "Your attacks show a lot of finesse. You don't do as much damage, but you cause more critical hits. All of your attacks lose 30% of their damage (after reductions are made for Damage Resistance, etc.) but you gain a 10% bonus to Critical Chance.",
		"hvyHandedInfo" : "You swing harder, not better. Your attacks are very brutal, but lack finesse. You rarely cause a good critical hit, but you always do more melee damage. You get a 4 point bonus to Melee Damage, but your critical hits do 30% less damage, and are 30% less likely to cripple a limb or cause unconsciousness.",
		"jinxedInfo" : "The good thing is that everyone around you has more critical failures in combat. The bad thing is: so do you! If you, a member of your party, or a non-player character have a failure in combat, there is a greater likelihood the failure will be upgraded (downgraded?) to a critical failure. ",
		"kamikazeInfo" : "By not paying attention to any threats, you can act a lot faster in a turn. This lowers your Armor Class to just what you are wearing, but you sequence much faster in a combat turn. You have no natural Armor Class (Armor Class is therefore 0 regardless of Agility). You must wear armor to get an Armor Class. Your sequence gets a 5 point bonus.",
		"oneHanderInfo" : "One of your hands is very dominant. You excel with single-handed weapons, but two-handed weapons cause a problem. You have a 40% penalty to hit with two-handed weapons, but get a 20% bonus to hit with weapons that only require one hand.",
		"chemReliantInfo" : "You are more easily addicted to chems. Your chance to be addicted is twice normal, but you recover in half the time from their ill effects. Robots cannot choose this trait.",
		"chemResistantInfo" : "Chems only affect you half as long as normal, but your chance to be addicted is only 50% the normal amount. Robots cannot choose this trait.",
		"fastMetabolismInfo" : " Your metabolic rate is twice normal. This means that you are much less resistant to radiation and poison, but your body heals faster. You get a 2 point bonus to Healing Rate, but your Radiation and Poison Resistance start at 0% (racial modifiers are added later). Robots cannot choose this trait.",
		"giftedInfo" : "You have more innate abilities than most, so you have not spent as much time honing your skills. Your statistics are better than the average person, but your skills are lacking.  All Stats get a 1 point bonus, but all skills get a 10% penalty and you receive 5 less Skill Points per level. Robots cannot choose this trait.",
		"goodNaturedInfo" : "You studied less-combative skills as you were growing up. Your combat skills start at a lower level, but Medicine, Speech, Repair, Science and Barter are substantially improved. Those skills get a 15% bonus. You get a 10% penalty to starting combat skills (Small Guns, Big Guns, Energy Weapons, Unarmed, and Melee Weapons). This is a one-time bonus. Animals and robots cannot choose this trait.",
		"nightPersonInfo" : "As a night-time person, you are more awake when the sun goes down. Your Intelligence and Perception are improved at night but are dulled during the day. You get a 1 point penalty to these Statistics from 0601 to 1800, and a 1 point bonus to these Stats from 1801 to 0600. This bonus cannot take Intelligence and Perception above the character’s racial maximum or below the character’s racial minimum.",
		"sexAppealInfo" : "When interacting with members of the opposite sex, you gain a 1 point bonus to Charisma for reactions. When making Speech and Barter rolls, you gain a 40% bonus for each. When interacting with members of the same sex, you have a 1 point penalty to Charisma and have a 40% penalty to both Speech and Barter rolls.",
		"skilledInfo" : "Since you spend more time improving your skills than a normal person, you gain more skill points. The tradeoff is that you do not gain as many extra abilities. You will gain a perk at one level higher than normal. You will get an additional 5 skill points per new experience level, and a one-time bonus of +10% to your skills when you begin the game.",
		"smallFrameInfo" : "You are not quite as big as everyone else, but that never slowed you down. You can't carry as much, but you are more agile. You get a 1 point bonus to Agility, but your Carry Weight is only 15 lbs X Strength.",
		"techWizardInfo" : "You spent your formative years hunched over a bench learning all about the way things work. The trouble is that you’ve ruined your eyes! You get a +15% bonus to Science, Repair, Energy Weapons, and Lockpick skills, but you lose 1 Perception. Deathclaws and Dogs cannot choose this trait.",
		"hamFistedInfo" : "Genetic engineering – or dumb luck – has endowed you with huge hands. You get a “free” tag skill in Unarmed, but you suffer a -20% penalty to Small Guns, Medicine, Repair, Science, and Lockpick Skills (these numbers cannot go below 0%). Only Mutants can choose this trait.",		
		"vatSkinInfo" : "you gain a +10 bonus to your Armor Class thanks to your extra-tough skin. The bad news is that everyone within ten hexes of your location, friend and foe, suffers a 1-point penalty to Perception (you are unaffected). Only Mutants can choose this trait.",
		"glowingOneInfo" : " Your glow eliminates modifiers from light in combat for both you and your enemies. In addition, you gain a +50% bonus to Radiation Resistance, but everyone around you takes 10 rads per hour. Only Ghouls can choose this trait.",			
		"domesticatedInfo" : "You have undergone extensive house training and have developed an above average Intelligence. Your IN is raised by 1, and can even go above your racial maximum, but you get a –2 penalty to Melee Damage. ( Only Deathclaws and Dogs can choose this trait.)",
		"rabidInfo" : "You are a half-crazed, feral killing machine. You are not affected by crippled limbs (blindness still affects you normally), and every time you kill an opponent in combat, you get 5 more APs that round. Chems, including stimpaks, have no effect on you. Only Deathclaws and Dogs can choose this trait.",			
		"fearTheReaperInfo" : "You have cheated death!  You gain perks as if you were a human, but you are now on death’s short list.  This means that once a month, you must roll against Luck or else drop dead. Only Ghouls can choose this trait. ",
		"builtToDestroyInfo" : "You’ve learned how to maximize your potential for harm. Gain an additional (+)2 AP. However every level up you gain health equal to ⅓ Endurance + 2, instead.",		
		"hotBloodedInfo" : "When your health is 50% or lower, your damage is increased by (+)5. Unfortunately your Perception and Agility are decreased by (-)2 as well.",
		"triggerDisciplineInfo" : "Not the Fastest, but always the most precise. You use the Melee target shot modifiers for Ranged weapons now! Due to your slow speed though Ranged weapons take 1 additional AP to use."
